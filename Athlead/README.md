# AthLEAD

A chatbot dedicated to Rebecca Dovi, the greatest computer science teacher of all time.

### Features

* Organizes data from website into easily parsable arraylist format
* Search feature allows user to check into the system, changing their status for particular events

### How it works

Utilizes JSoup, which opens the url of diablo timing, atkins track, or whatever other results page in use. Webscrapes through any Diablo Timing track meet results page and returns large string. Organizes string into arraylists based on events, heat, and each athlete's data.

It's a search engine, so you can find various related data on any athlete (grade, school, races/heats, hip number) and manipulate that data if need be.

### Cool Commands (edit later)

* Analyze
  * Returns a summary of your grades, and tells you how you're doing.
* Death Valley
  * "YOU WENT TO DEATH VALLEY???"
* Names of Cool People
  * Try it out! You won't regret it.
  
### Things to do in the future (edit later)

* Improve GUI (e.g. use IBM Watson)
* Implement a library or more APIs
* Add pictures of Dovi
* Hide password
* Improve the "analyze" command
  * More commands that tell you info about grade?
   * Class rank
   * Grade needed on final
   * Which classes to study first
